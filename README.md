CIMB is a digital bank that offers GSave and UpSave savings accounts.   As with a typical Savings Account, it contains accountNumber, accountName, and a balance for that account.

The typical savings account offers an interest rate of 1%.
The benefits of the typical savings account is the same with the "Standard Savings Account" as compared to other banks.

The GSave account offers an interest rate of 2.5%.
Benefits include the "Standard Savings Account" plus access to "GCash transfer".

The UpSave account offers the highest interest rate of 4.0%.
Benefits include the "Standard Savings Account" plus "with Insurance".

The content of your Cimb.java should ONLY contain the following codes with the exception of inserting your own package name :




public class Cimb {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		SavingsAccount account = new SavingsAccount();
		
		account.setAccountNumber(1234);
		account.setAccountName("Juan Dela Cruz");
		account.setBalance(10000.0);
		
		System.out.println(account.showInfo());
		System.out.println("Account type: " + account.showAccountType());
		System.out.println("Interest rate: " + account.getInterestRate());
		System.out.println("New balance: " + account.computeBalanceWithInterest());
		System.out.println("Benefits: " + account.showBenefits());
		
		System.out.println("----------------------");
		
		GSave gSave = new GSave(account);
		System.out.println(gSave.showInfo());
		System.out.println("Account type: " + gSave.showAccountType());
		System.out.println("Interest rate: " + gSave.getInterestRate());
		System.out.println("New balance: " + gSave.computeBalanceWithInterest());
		System.out.println("Benefits: " + gSave.showBenefits());
		
		System.out.println("----------------------");
		
		UpSave upSave = new UpSave(account);
		System.out.println(upSave.showInfo());
		System.out.println("Account type: " + upSave.showAccountType());
		System.out.println("Interest rate: " + upSave.getInterestRate());
		System.out.println("New balance: " + upSave.computeBalanceWithInterest());
		System.out.println("Benefits: " + upSave.showBenefits());
	}
}
